# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

This is a **basic Machine Learning project** built using Python to classify sonar signals as either **Rock** or **Mine**.  
The project uses **Logistic Regression** and demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset Source: [Kaggle - Sonar Rock vs Mine Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taseermehboob9/submarine-sonar-rock-or-mine-dataset)
- It contains 208 samples with 60 features each, representing sonar signals.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Train-Test Split, Accuracy Score)

---

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing  
2. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets  
3. Training the Logistic Regression model  
4. Evaluating performance using accuracy score  
5. Making predictions on new sonar signals  

---

## 📈 Results
- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of **76%** on the test data.  

## 🤝 Future Scope
- Try other algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)  
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy  
- Build a small web app using Flask/Streamlit to input signals and predict
